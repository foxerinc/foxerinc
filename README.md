## 🚀 A bit about my journey

I started out building Android apps because, honestly, seeing something you coded actually *work* on a device felt like magic. That led me down a rabbit hole into backend development, and now I can't imagine building an app without understanding what's happening on the server side.

Recently I spent **6 months in a full-time, project-based program at SeaLabs Indonesia**, building production-style services with **Go + PostgreSQL** on the backend and **React + TypeScript** on the frontend. That’s where a lot of my “e-wallet / library / pharmacy” projects come from – the code is mine, the expectations were real.

These days, I'm that person who gets genuinely excited about:

- Writing Go APIs that don't fall apart under load
- Making React UIs that actually feel smooth to use
- Database queries that don't make your server cry
- And still shipping the occasional **Kotlin / Jetpack Compose** app when Android Studio calls my name again

I graduated from Universitas Kristen Duta Wacana with a 3.92 GPA on a full scholarship (still grateful for that). But the real education came from debugging “why is this transaction deadlocking at 2 AM” and finally understanding how things fit together.

**What I care about:** code that's easy to read six months later, clear boundaries between layers, and systems that behave well under stress instead of “only works on my machine”.

**Current mission:** building a portfolio of projects that don't just work, but work *well*. The kind of code I'd be happy to hand over to another developer and not feel guilty about.

## 🎓 Recent hands-on experience

- **SeaLabs Indonesia – Full-stack Engineering Program (Batch 07, 6 months, full-time)**  
  Built several production-style projects (e-wallet, library system, healthcare platform) using **Go, PostgreSQL, React, TypeScript**.  
  Worked with clean architecture, relational modeling, Docker, and basic testing / load testing in a team-like environment.

- **Assistant Lecturer – Programming & Android**  
  Helped students with algorithms, data structures, and Android development, which quietly forced me to actually understand what I was explaining.

### 🖥️ Backend
- **Language:** Go  
- **API style:** RESTful APIs, resource-based routing, query params for pagination/sorting/filtering  
- **Auth:** JWT-based authentication, basic session handling  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, migrations, SQL joins, indexes, constraints, transactions  
- **Architecture:** Layered / clean architecture (handler → service → repository)  
- **Concurrency:** Goroutines & channels, context usage (cancellation, deadlines)  
- **Testing:** Basic unit & integration tests, load testing with k6  
- **Tools:** Docker, Postman/Insomnia  

> **Learning:** OAuth2 / Google login for auth flows

### 💻 Frontend
- **Core:** React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3  
- **Routing & data:** React Router, TanStack Query (React Query) for server state & caching  
- **Frameworks:** Basic Next.js, Vite for bundling/dev  
- **State:** Zustand (store slices, derived state), React context  
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui (Radix-based components), responsive layout  
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit tests), basic React component testing  
- **UX:** Forms & validation, error states, loading skeletons, protected routes  

### 📱 Mobile (Android)
- **Stack:** Kotlin, Android Native, Jetpack Compose  
- **Architecture:** MVVM, Clean Architecture, SOLID principles  
- **Libraries:** Room, Retrofit, Coroutines, Hilt (DI), WorkManager, Navigation, ViewModel  
- **Integration:** REST APIs, auth flows, Firebase (Auth, Realtime DB, FCM)  

### 🛠️ Tools & Practices

- **CI/CD:** Basic GitHub Actions workflows  
- **Containers:** Docker, Docker Compose for local dev setups  
- **Environment:** Linux, VS Code, Android Studio  
- **Docs:** Swagger / OpenAPI for API documentation  
- **Practices:** ERD modeling, request validation, error handling, separation of concerns, readable functions  

### 🌱 Currently exploring
- Redis for caching and rate limiting  
- Deeper observability (structured logs, metrics, traces)  
- Stronger testing strategies for Go services (table-driven tests, mocks)

## 💻 Projects I'm not embarrassed to show

> Production-style projects with proper READMEs, ERDs, and instructions. Currently cleaning them up for open source.

**🏦 E-Wallet API** — *Go · PostgreSQL · Docker*  
REST API for wallets, top-ups, and transfers. Learned a lot about transaction isolation levels here. Features clean architecture, proper error handling, pagination/filtering, and k6 load tests because “it works on my machine” isn’t good enough.

**📚 Library Management Service** — *Go · PostgreSQL*  
Borrow/return system with late penalties. Built proper indexes because watching a query go from 2 seconds to 20ms is oddly satisfying. Includes sorting, filtering, and transaction-safe operations.

**💊 Pharmacy Web App** — *React · TypeScript · Zustand*  
Product listings, pharmacist management, authenticated flows. Responsive UI that actually looks decent on mobile. State management with Zustand because sometimes Redux is overkill.

**📱 BearBull Portfolio Tracker** — *Kotlin · Android*  
MVVM architecture, Room for offline storage, Hilt for DI, WorkManager for syncing. Built this to track stock portfolios, but really it was an excuse to learn modern Android architecture properly.

**🧬 Fingerprint Gender Classification** — *Python · Machine Learning*  
My thesis project using LBP and ridge density features with SVM. Turns out fingerprints have subtle differences between genders. Who knew?

## 💬 Let's talk

I'm currently looking for **backend, frontend, or full-stack roles** where I can contribute from day one and keep learning. If you're building something interesting (or just want to chat about why Go's error handling is actually good), reach out:
